# Computer Vision with OpenCV

This repository is dedicated to my studies in **Computer Vision using
OpenCV**.

It covers **fundamental concepts**, **image processing techniques**, and
**practical experiments** implemented with **Python**.

The goal of this project is to build a solid understanding of how
computer vision works in practice, from basic image operations to more
advanced techniques.
